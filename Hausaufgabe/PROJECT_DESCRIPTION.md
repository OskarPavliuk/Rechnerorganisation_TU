Project Description for the Assembly Language Assignments

This repository contains my solutions for two specific assignments in assembly language programming. The details of the tasks are as follows:

1. **Morse Code Decoder Assignment:**
    - **Objective:** Develop an assembly program to decode Morse code into readable text.
    - **Key Features Implemented:**
        - Decoding of Morse code sequences into corresponding alphabetic characters.
        - Handling of standard Morse code conventions and symbols.
    - **Note:** Due to confidentiality agreements, as detailed in the `DISCLAIMER.md` file, I cannot publish the specific rules and requirements set by TU Berlin for this assignment.

2. **Roman Numeral Decoder Assignment:**
    - **Objective:** Create an assembly program to convert Roman numerals into their equivalent decimal numbers.
    - **Scope of the Task:**
        - The program handles conversion for a predefined range of Roman numerals.
        - Implementation complies with certain prescribed rules and conditions for decoding.
    - **Note:** Similar to the first assignment, the detailed task requirements and conditions from TU Berlin are not disclosed here, adhering to the confidentiality outlined in the `DISCLAIMER.md`.
    
For further information or queries, please refer to the `DISCLAIMER.md` file.
